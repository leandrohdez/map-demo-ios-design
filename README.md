# ⛽️ Gas Stations (demo). Using MapKit & CoreLocation.

Developed example inspired by the design [Car Refilling App](https://dribbble.com/shots/17058858-Car-Refilling-App?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=dlauretsky&utm_content=Car%20Refilling%20App&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=dlauretsky&utm_content=Car%20Refilling%20App&utm_medium=Social_Share) by [Dmitry Lauretsky](https://dribbble.com/dlauretsky) for Ronas IT | UI/UX Team. I take this opportunity to congratulate Dmitry Lauretsky for the excellent work.

## SOLID Principles
The development of the project was carried out based on the principles of single responsibility of high cohesion and low coupling, collected as SOLID principles of software engineering. 

## Architecture
Designed in a multilayer architecture, which constitutes an object-oriented system organized in several layers or levels. Each of these layers or levels contains a set of classes with responsibilities related to the layer to which they belong.  

## Architecture pattern
To take advantage of these advantages, I have relied on the SwiftUI language for the implementation of the presentation layer, as well as the architecture pattern: **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** that allowed me to exploit its full potential.
